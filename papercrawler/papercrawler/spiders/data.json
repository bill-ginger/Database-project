A prestigious group of &lt;a href=\\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/graphical-models/editorial-board/\\"&gt;editors&lt;/a&gt; selected from among the premier international researchers in their fields oversees the review process.\\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because timely publication of research results is important for the careers of our authors and for the vitality of the field, &lt;em&gt;GMOD&lt;/em&gt; is putting in place its R3 (Rapid Response Review) system, which strives to provide authors with a preliminary decision within an average of one month after &lt;a href=\\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/GMOD/default.aspx\\"&gt;submission&lt;/a&gt;.\\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are examples of topics typically covered in &lt;em&gt;GMOD&lt;/em&gt;:\\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape Processing&lt;/strong&gt;: Analysis of local properties.
